Instructions for adding the PrioVR driver to Interface
Andrzej Kapolka, May 12, 2014

1. Copy the PrioVR sdk folders (include, *.lib) into the interface/external/priovr folder.
   This readme.txt should be there as well.

2. Copy the PrioVR DLLs from the API into your path.

3. Delete your build directory, run cmake and build, and you should be all set.
