Instructions for adding the Faceplus driver to Interface
Andrzej Kapolka, April 8, 2014

1. Copy the Faceplus sdk folders (include, win32) into the interface/external/faceplus folder.
   This readme.txt should be there as well.

2. Copy the Faceplus DLLs from the win32 folder into your path.

3. Delete your build directory, run cmake and build, and you should be all set.
