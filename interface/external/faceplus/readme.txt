Instructions for adding the Faceplus driver to Interface
Andrzej Kapolka, April 8, 2014

1. Copy the Faceplus sdk folders (include, win32) into the interface/external/faceplus folder.
   This readme.txt should be there as well.

2. Delete your build directory, run cmake and build, and you should be all set.
