Collection of scripts to create server distribution packages.  Most of these scripts assume
use of the build script at https://github.com/daleglass/athena-builder, specifically that
the following directory structure exists

base folder/
	source/		git checkout
	build/		result of cmake build
	qt5-install/	installed or built Qt5 installation


Ubuntu:
	DEBEMAIL="your-email@somewhere.com" DEBFULLNAME="Your Full Name" ./make-deb-server

	This script will retrieve the current git commit date and hash and assemble a version from it.
	It will attempt construct a .deb file in the pkg-scripts folder, assuming the Athena base folder
	is located at ../..

Amazon Linux 2:
	ATHENA=~/Athena rpmbuild --target x86_64 -bb ./athena-server.spec

	This command takes an ATHENA environment variable set to the base folder and attempts to build
	an .rpm file.  The result will be in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS.  The version number is currently
	hardcoded inside of the athena-server.spec file
